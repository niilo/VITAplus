# 20: Take the Plus Double Buffer fallback for the stock driver

Status: claimed
Claimed: 2026-09-28 Claude Code session (Opus 5.5)
Type: task
Label: ready-for-agent
Blocked by: 19

## Context

Plus commit 14521654 runs Page Table and Native Buffer as Double Buffer on
the stock Qualcomm driver, because those modes crash there. Ticket 10
tests the modes on Turnip.

Commits: 14521654.

## Steps

1. Branch `pocket-s/20-plus-stock-double-buffer` from `master`.
2. `git cherry-pick -x` each commit, in the order below. Resolve conflicts
   so that the result matches the commit's intent. Record each conflict
   under `## Answer`.
3. Build both targets: `container/vita3k.sh build` and
   `container/vita3k.sh android release`. Run `container/vita3k.sh test`.
4. Merge to `master`. The code base decision (ticket 02) keeps these
   commits.
5. On the device: install the release APK and boot one game. Copy the
   Vulkan lines of `vita3k.log` under `## Answer`. If the game does not
   boot, find the commit with `git bisect` and revert it.
